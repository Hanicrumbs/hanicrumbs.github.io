# Hanicrumbs "Digital" Garden

Hej and welcome to my digital garden. Hier I will sporadically post new stuff relating to... well, anything.
This site is used as a personal site to gather lose text and ideas in one place.
There is no guarantee that I'll be keeping this site up-to-date, or even that I'll be posting regularly here.

Check out my "[About](about.md)" page for information on how to contact me.
Otherwise you can check out the "[Links](links.md)" page for relevant links to different pages on my site.
